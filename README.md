    # Password-check
A Python password checker.
A simple Python script that checks password strength using the regular expression module(RegEx)

    ## REQUIREMENTS:
Python
-To install Python, I recommend using Visual Studio Code and Searching for a Python installment. You do not need any more libraries.

    ##To run the script:
1.Open Visual Studio Code(This will be referred to as VSC)
2. click the elipsis at the top
  -select terminal
3.In Github: select password-check, then click on code, and copy the HTTPS link
4.In VSC terminal type git clone (then paste the https link)
5.After cloning the repo, click file, then open folder, find the folder with password-check, select it
6.Once you see all of the code click the play icon located at the top right of the viewing
7.In the terminal, it will prompt you to enter a password to check.
9.It will automatically check to see if all conditions have been met and which ones have not, telling you which ones have not or if they all have been met it will say the password is viable.

    ## Rules of the password check/ Features  
-It has to meet the minimum length requirement of 10 character
-Has to have one Uppercase letter and one Lowercase letter
-At least one number
-At least one special character

    ## Future improvements
-Adjust to meet other Security+ standards
-Integrate with an API to check leaked passwords
-Create a prompt to say clearly what is needed when opening the terminal
